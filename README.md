It is a cache efficient implementation of the Regular Value Iteration algorithm for solving MDPs


NOTES

This is using the MDPs generated by the GPS distribution of david Wingate.

For the generators, different problems are selected at *compile* time,
which is why different executables are generated for each problem.
Currently, the problem desired is selected as a compile define.  Other
options, such as the timestep and gamma, can be set via command-line
parameters.


Since we are using hte same format of MDP and the results as Wingate we may be able to use their plotting library to visualize. Need to test if that will work though.

There is some support for plotting the resulting value function, using
the GEOMVIEW viewer.  To do this, make GPS dump the resulting value
function with the "save_fn" command-line option.  Then, use the
appropriate generator with the "plotvf" option.
